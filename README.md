# Image-Classifier
This is a convolution neural network trained using gpu to check whether the images are of following categories 
1.Buildings
2.Mountains
3.Sea
4.Street
5.Forest
6.Glacier
The data for this can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification. I highly recommend keeping it on a ssd during the training phase
